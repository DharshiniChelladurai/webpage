        <p>Monarch butterflies live in North, Central, and South America as well as Australia, some Pacific Islands, India, and Western Europe.<br>
             Their markings include bright orange wings covered with black veins and rimmed with a black border and white dots. 
             <br>Females have thicker veins in their wings. 
             <br>A monarch's brilliant coloring tells predators: "Don't eat me. I'm poisonous." The butterflies get their toxins from a plant called milkweed, which is their only food source in the caterpillar stage.
            <br> An animal that eats a monarch butterfly usually doesn't die, but it feels sick enough to avoid monarchs in the future.

            Vanessa atalanta, the red admiral or, previously, the red admirable,[3] is a well-characterized, medium-sized butterfly with black wings, red bands, and white spots. 
            <br>It has a wingspan of about 2 inches (5 cm).
            <br>It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. <br>
            The red admiral is widely distributed across temperate regions of North Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean.

            Nymphalis antiopa, known as the mourning cloak in North America and the Camberwell beauty in Britain, is a large butterfly native to Eurasia and North America.
<br>The immature form of this species is sometimes known as the spiny elm caterpillar.<br> Other older names for this species include grand surprise and white petticoat.
<br> A powerful flier, this species is sometimes found in areas far from its usual range during migration.

<br>These butterflies have a lifespan of 11 to 12 months, one of the longest lifespans for any butterfly

        <p>Aglais io, the European peacock,[3][4][5] more commonly known simply as the peacock butterfly, is a colourful butterfly, found in Europe and temperate Asia as far east as Japan.
            <br> It was formerly classified as the only member of the genus Inachis (the name is derived from Greek mythology, meaning Io, the daughter of Inachus[citation needed]).
            <br> It should not be confused or classified with the "American peacocks" in the genus Anartia; while belonging to the same family as the European peacock, Nymphalidae, the American peacocks are not close relatives of the Eurasian species. 
            <br>The peacock butterfly is resident in much of its range, often wintering in buildings or trees.
            <br> It therefore often appears quite early in spring. 
            <br>The peacock butterfly has figured in research in which the role of eyespots as an anti-predator mechanism has been investigated.
            <br>The peacock is expanding its range and is not known to be threatened.

        <P>Papilio glaucus, the eastern tiger swallowtail, is a species of butterfly native to eastern North America.
            <br> It is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern United States,[3] ranging north to southern Ontario, Canada,[4] and is common in many different habitats. 
            <br>It flies from spring until fall, during which it produces two to three broods.

        <p>Papilio polyxenes, the (eastern) black swallowtail, American swallowtail or parsnip swallowtail,[4] is a butterfly found throughout much of North America. It is the state butterfly of Oklahoma, Michigan[5], and New Jersey.
            <br>An extremely similar-appearing species, Papilio joanae, occurs in the Ozark Mountains region, but it appears to be closely related to Papilio machaon, rather than P. polyxenes.

        <p>The Long-tailed Blue is an exotic migrant from the Mediterranean with a handful typically reaching UK shores each year, but experts believe climate change is behind this butterfly reaching our shores more regularly and in vastly increased numbers.

        <P>The emerald swallowtail (Papilio palinurus) is sometimes called a banded peacock, but it might just as easily be called a chameleon. Like the shade-shifting lizard, the emerald swallowtail changes color depending on the angle of the light, and it has a strikingly disparate appearance from one side to the other.

            The bright bands on the butterfly’s generally dark green upper side aren’t caused by pigments but by the surface of unique microstructures in the scales on its wings.
            <br> When the scales reflect blue and yellow light, their tight arrangement allows the colors to mix together and be perceived as the iridescent green bands from which the butterfly takes its common name.
